        to disrupt sites\nHackers are exploiting a serious flaw in the internet''s
        architecture, according to a security firm.\n\nThe bug targets systems which
        convert domain names into IP addresses.\n\nExploiting it could threaten the
        smooth running of internet services as it allows hackers to launch denial-of-service
        attacks on websites, potentially forcing them offline.\n\nRegular internet
        users are unlikely to be severely affected, however.\n\nBind is the name of
        a variety of Domain Name System (DNS) software used on the majority of internet
        servers.\n\nThe recently identified bug allows attackers to crash the software,
        therefore taking the DNS service offline and preventing URLs, for example,
        from working.\n\nA patch for the flaw is already available, but many systems
        are yet to be updated.\n\nThe Internet Systems Consortium (ISC), which develops
        Bind, said in a tweet that the vulnerability was \"particularly critical\"
        and \"easily exploited\".\n\nDaniel Cid, a networking expert at Sucuri has
        published a blog post on the vulnerability in which he explained that real
        exploits taking advantage of the flaw have already happened.\n\nHe told the
        BBC: \"A few of our clients, in different industries, had their DNS servers
        crashed because of it.\n\n\"Based on our experience, server software, like
        Bind, Apache, OpenSSL and others, do not get patched as often as they should.\"\n\nCybersecurity
        expert Brian Honan commented that a spike in exploits of the flaw was expected
        over the next few days.\n\nHowever, he added that websites would often still
        be accessible via other routes and cached addresses on DNS servers around
        the world, even when certain key DNS servers have been made to crash.\n\n\"It''s
        not a doomsday scenario, it''s a question of making sure the DNS structure
        can continue to work while patches are rolled out,\" he said.\n\nThe impact
        on general internet users is likely to be minimal, according to Mr Cid.\n\n\"Average
        internet users won''t feel much pain, besides a few sites and email servers
        down,\" he said.","results":[{"endpoint":"entities","result":{"language":"en","entities":{"keyword":["internet
