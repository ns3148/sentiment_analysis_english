    body: {string: "{\n  \"text\": \"Working with text is often a messy business for
        programmers. While code has to be unambiguous, words tend to be anything but.
        Over the years, a number of companies like Alchemy and Thomson Reuters have
        launched services based on natural language processing (NLP) and machine-learning
        algorithms to help developers more easily extract meaning from documents.
        Now, Aylien is joining the fray with its own text-analysis API, the first
        in a series of developers services the company is working on.\\n\\nThe service
        was founded by Dublin, Ireland-based Parsa Ghaffari, with the backing of Chinaccelerator.
        Ghaffari told me that he first applied to the accelerator program with the
        idea for a product that used NLP to automatically pull up relevant data while
        you were writing about it. It turned out, though, that the underlying technology
        for this didn\u2019t exist. He then set out to build the technology, and the
        result of this \u2014 after almost three years of work \u2014 is Aylien.\\n\\nThe
        API allows developers to quickly extract basic data like headlines and the
        body of text from a document, but it also offers a summarization service,
        entity and concept extraction, and language and sentiment detection. I\u2019ve
        used the API for a couple of personal projects and with the exception of a
        few issues, it worked as advertised. It doesn\u2019t like texts in languages
        other than English, though, and was almost 100 percent confident that this
        German post about Google\u2019s latest Street View project expansion was actually\_about
        curling. The company is working on support for other languages.\\n\\nIf you
        want to give the service a try, just head over here and plug a URL into Aylien\u2019s
        API demo.\\n\\nAll of the data comes back as JSON and the company uses Mashape\_to
        sell access to its data.\_Developers who need to make fewer than 1,000 API
        calls per day get free access to the service, and those who need more can
        sign up for paid plans, starting at $199 for 6,000 calls per day. That\u2019s
        a bit more affordable than what most of Aylien\u2019s competitors currently
        charge, though not by a wide margin.\\n\\nCurrently, the Aylien team consists
        of three engineers and none of them hold PhDs. That\u2019s pretty unusual
        for an NLP startup. While Ghaffari has ties to the academic NLP world, he
        credits the fact that there are no academics on his team for the pragmatic
        approach the company takes.\\n\\nThe next project the company is tackling
        is a news API\_for filtering news stories and a number of consumer products
        that will sit on top of the technologies the team built for its developer
        services.\",\n  \"sentences\": [\"Over the years, a number of companies like
