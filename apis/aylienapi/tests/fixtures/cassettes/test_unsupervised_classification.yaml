    body: {string: "{\"text\":\"When Microsoft announced its wrenching\_$7.6 billion
        write-down last week, it was\_easy to presume\_that the company\_was giving
        up on\_mobile. At the very least, the financial avalanche\_sent a strong signal
        that Windows phone in its current guise has failed in a major\_way.\\n\\nThe
        7,800 people sacked in the process, the majority of whom came from the Windows
        phone division, simply accentuated\_that point.\\n\\nMicrosoft has badly wanted
        to be a player in the handset wars, but its market share numbers tell a consistently
        wretched\_tale. In the US, it has never managed more than a crawl, and is
        currently stuck\_at around the 3 percent mark.\_The company has seen somewhat
        higher numbers in some European markets, but there has been evidence that
        even those relative\_cratonic bastions have eroded in recent quarters.\\n\\nLuckily
        or smartly, Microsoft has placed more than one mobile bet and it doesn\u2019t
        intend to live and die with handsets. It has other\_bullets left in the chamber
        including Windows 10 and the cross-platform mobile apps too.\\n\\nWhatever
        happens, Microsoft can ultimately never walk away from\_mobile because giving
        up would essentially be ceding a massive portion of the\_future of computing,
        and it simply can\u2019t afford to do that.\\n\\nAfter some time in the soup,
        Microsoft has finally detailed its Windows mobile\_strategy well enough in
        the last week that we can understand it \u2014 whether that\u2019s referring
        to the operating system level, hardware or cross-platform apps. Leaning on
        Mary Jo Foley\u2019s excellent interview with CEO Satya Nadella, and the write-down,
        we can come to the following conclusions:\\n\\nThe company made a large wager
        through Windows 10\u2019s pricing to bolster Windows mobile.\\n\\nThat\u2019s
        quite plain: Microsoft wanted to go after phone market share in the long term,
        and selling Windows at its old price points would limit broader Windows 10
        adoption, eroding at the company\u2019s larger value proposition of having
        one platform across all your devices. Put another way, the company is foregoing
