    body: {string: "{\n  \"text\": \"Boeing confirms $4bn order from GE\\nGeneral
        Electric's aircraft leasing and financing arm has confirmed that it has placed
        an order for 40 Boeing planes worth $4bn (\xA32.3bn) at list prices.\\n\\nThe
        order was booked last year, but so far had been attributed to an \\\"unidentified
        customer\\\" by Boeing.\\n\\nGE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) said the
        new planes would help it meet growing demand for more fuel-efficient aircraft
        from its customers.\\n\\n\\\"Our airline customers require more fuel-efficient
        aircraft to compete in the marketplace,\\\" Norman CT Liu, chief executive
        of GECAS, said in a statement.\\n\\nGECAS has now placed total orders for
        95 units of 737 MAX 8 airplanes and 387 of the next-generation 737-800 jets
        making it the biggest buyer of the two models in the leasing industry.\\n\\nA
        slowdown in global travel demand, coupled with high fuel prices, has hurt
        the profitability of many airlines across the globe in recent years.\\n\\nAs
        a result, airlines have been looking to keep their costs in check to try and
        sustain their profitability.\\n\\nThat has in turn caused a rise in demand
        for fuel-efficient aircraft.\\n\\nThe 100-200 seat narrow-body - or single-aisle
        - aircraft market is forecast to generate $20 trillion (\xA312.8tn) over the
        next 20 years.\\n\\nThe sector is currently dominated by Airbus's A320 and
        Boeing's 737 aircraft, but other firms are also looking to tap into the market.\\n\\nBoeing
        has claimed that its next-generation 737's offer the \\\"lowest operating
        costs in its class\\\".\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"concepts\": {\n    \"http://dbpedia.org/resource/GE_Capital_Aviation_Services\":
